# Regression Approach for Hospital Stay

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the duration of a patient's hospital stay using a regression approach. The project includes the following components:

1. **Documentation**: The `doc` folder contains the thesis of a previous study related to this project.
2. **Data**: The `data` folder includes:
   - `cleaned`: Contains the cleaned and preprocessed data.
   - `raw`: Contains the raw data.
   - `FeatureExtracting.ipynb`: A notebook that demonstrates the process of data cleaning, feature extraction, and exploration.
   - `ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb`: A notebook that showcases the exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps.
3. **CITI Program Certificates**: The `CITI_PROGRAM_CERTIFICATES` folder contains the certificates required to access the MIMIC III data.
4. **Modeling**: The `modeling` folder includes four notebooks that explore different regression models for predicting hospital stay duration.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks smoothly, please follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed by running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
2. Navigate to the appropriate folders and open the respective notebooks to explore the data, perform EDA, and run the regression models.
3. Customize the notebooks as needed to fit your specific requirements or to explore different modeling approaches.
